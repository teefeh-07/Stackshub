## What is SereneHub?

SereneHub brings tranquility to decentralized finance on Bitcoin. Built on the Stacks blockchain, it offers a unified platform where digital assets flow naturally between creators, traders, and developers.

## Core Modules

### 🎨 NFT Marketplace
Mint and trade digital collectibles with transparent pricing and minimal friction. Each transaction is secured by Bitcoin's finality while maintaining low costs.

### 📋 Service Registry  
A decentralized directory where service providers can list their offerings and receive payments directly on-chain. No intermediaries, just direct connections.

### 🔒 Staking Vault
Lock your STX tokens and earn rewards over time. The longer you commit, the more you gain. Simple, secure, and transparent.

### 🚀 Token Launchpad
Deploy your own SIP-010 fungible tokens in minutes. Whether you're building a community currency or launching a protocol token, SereneHub makes it effortless.
